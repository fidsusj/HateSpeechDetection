Main focus was the analysis of the preprocessed dataset and providing insights for the milestone, before extracting features. After feature extraction hate speech statistics were drawn out to show what signifies hate speech. Additionally, the semantic features and the SVM classifier were added. To handle the unbalanced dataset undersampling in the form of randomly deleting overrepresented instances and oversampling using synthetic generation of underrepresented instances (via SMOTE) was implemented.

Faced challenges when trying to provide meaningful insights into the hate speech statistics as a lot of features were count-based and e.g. did not contain the occurring laughing expression or PoS pattern. Furthermore, balancing the dataset did not fare well for performance and it was not possible to apply SMOTE for the neural network approach.

Took care of the data preparation and corpus building based on the two utilized datasets. Also setup the GitHub actions and hooks for CI. Added the Logistic Regression classifier and implemented a Word2Vec model. Furthermore, implemented the PoS pattern feature, as well as ngrams and a topic detection based on LDA. In the analysis had a close look at the feature importance for the different classifiers.

\subsubsection*{Nils Krehl}

Big contribution was the development of the reusable pipeline for adding new features to the feature extraction, adding classifiers and executing grid search and learning the optimal hyperparameters for the classifiers. Added Random Forrest and Decision Tree as classifiers as well as implemented a neural network baseline via LSTM. Added a few features such as sentiment, dictionary and TF-IDF.
