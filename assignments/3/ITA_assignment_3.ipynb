Note that this is not a multi-label task, and we assume that each new complaint is assigned to one and only one category. The data comes from https://www.data.gov/ (US government’s open data) and contains complaints that are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whatever comes first.\n"

Remove the missing values, rename `Consumer complaint narrative` to `Narrative` for ease of use, and add a column encoding the product as an integer. This will represent your labels for classification and the mapping will be used later on. Create two dictionaries: one mapping the ids to products and one mapping products to their ids."
